greasemonkey script to auto-kill Youtube TV offer.

I wouldn't install this (yet). 

Now that I have YouTube Premium, apparently I'm a big dumb mark, so now they want me to buy all their other garbage. Notably, YouTube TV.

I haven't proven this works yet. They don't just serve you a page with content like normal people, they have to dynamically retrieve it (ugh). So when you try to save an offline copy of the webpage, you get blocked for cross-origin. That's why it's a huge annoying alert. Once this works I'll remove the alert and update.
